## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm
- Git

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

## Code Style

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Define types for props and state
- Avoid `any` type
- Use interfaces for objects

### React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful prop names
- Add prop validation

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (`MyComponent.tsx`)
- Functions: camelCase (`handleClick`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`API_BASE_URL`)
- Files: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities

### File Organization
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/    # React components
â”œâ”€â”€ providers/     # API providers
â”œâ”€â”€ stores/        # State management
